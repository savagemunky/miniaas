                <p>
                    Mini Infrastructure as a Service (Mini IaaS) is a Infrastructure as a Service project that is
                    designed to run on low-cost and low-power hardware such as Raspberry Pi's. The idea is not to
                    replace traditional infrastructure, but rather to support and assist it. This is achieved by
                    taking smaller services such as DHCP, DNS, NTP, and domain controller off of primary IaaS
                    solutions and putting them on Mini IaaS.
